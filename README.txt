Project's name : Hextech 3.0

Project's main use case : allows user to transfer various types of crypto coins .

Introduction : Hextech is basically a reactjs website that is still in the development phase .
I am creating this website with the help of visual studio code and nodejs and in addition to 
the main use case , users will be able to :
           - Connect their wallet to the website 
           - Transfer crypto coins (for now I will be just be trying to focus on just solana)
           - Check the transactions history .
